## Description of the tutorial

Computational neuroscience projects often involve a large number of
simulations for parameter search of computer models, which generates a
large amount of data. With the advances in computer hardware, software
methods, and cloud computing opportunities making this task easier,
the amount of collected data has exploded, similar to what has been
happening in many fields. High-performance computing (HPC) methods
have been used in the computational neuroscience field for a
while. However, the use of novel data science and big data methods is
less frequent.  In this tutorial, we will review tools already
established in the big data field and demonstrate their usefulness in
computational neuroscience workflows, focusing
on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). Spark is a distributed
computing framework used either for model simulation or for
post-processing and analysis of the generated data. The tutorial will
also have a session focusing on creating interactive
visualizations. We will review novel web-based interactive notebook
technologies based on Javascript
([Observable](https://observablehq.com/)) and Python
([Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)).

### Software tools

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Observable](https://observablehq.com/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

### Expected knowledge/materials

- Some familiarity with Python, Javascript, HTML
- Command-line usage for accessing remote servers
- For the visualization session: Google Account suggested for being
  able to use the online Jupyter notebook service
  at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
