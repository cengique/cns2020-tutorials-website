### Description of the tutorial

Computational neuroscience projects often involve large number of
simulations for parameter search of computer models, which generates
large amount of data. With the advances in computer hardware, software
methods, and cloud computing opportunities making this task easier,
the amount of collected data has exploded, similar to what has been
happening in many fields. High performance computing (HPC) methods
have been used in the computational neuroscience field for a
while. However, use of novel data science and big data methods are
less frequent. In this tutorial, we will review established HPC
methods and introduce novel data science tools to be used in
computational neuroscience workflows, starting from the industry
standard of [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) to newer
tools, such as [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). These tools
can be used for either model simulation or post-processing and
analysis of the generated data. To visualize the data, we will review
novel web-based interactive dashboard technologies mostly based on
Javascript and Python.

### Software tools

- [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/)
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)

### Expected knowledge/materials

- Some familiarity with Python, Javascript, HTML
- For the visualization session: Google Account suggested to use the online Jupyter notebook service at [Colab](colab.research.google.com/)
